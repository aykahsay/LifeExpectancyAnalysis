# Life Expectancy Analysis

# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes life expectancy trends across different countries over time using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and comparative insights.

## Data Sources
- The dataset contains life expectancy records from various countries spanning different time periods.
- Data includes variations in life expectancy due to historical events, health crises, and economic factors.

## Key Findings
1. **Data Availability:**
   - Sweden and the UK have the longest available records.
   - Most countries have data starting from the 1900s.
   - The USSR has limited data points.

2. **Life Expectancy Trends:**
   - General increase in life expectancy over time.
   - Declines observed in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa around 2000â€“2005 due to HIV/AIDS.
   - Recovery in life expectancy post-2005 due to healthcare improvements.
   - Temporary decline in 2020 due to COVID-19.

3. **Countries with Highest & Lowest Life Expectancy:**
   - **Lowest:** USSR, South Sudan, Mali, Sierra Leone, Niger.
   - **Highest:** Israel, Guernsey, San Marino, Andorra, Monaco.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Filtering relevant years and country records.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Checking summary statistics.
   - Identifying trends and anomalies.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Line charts comparing life expectancy trends.
   - Bar charts for highest and lowest life expectancy rankings.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy

## Future Enhancements
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conduct hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA) on life expectancy variations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use regression models to forecast life expectancy.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Implement Plotly or Dash for dynamic exploration.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis.
